Inoue Naohisa refers as his imaginary world as Iblard, a place created from his memories and dreams, as well as reality, when all things complement each other and create beauty, that is Iblard, in his words “Have you ever faced a beautiful landscape in the country-side, or perhaps even in a city, a landscape which you thought was so beautiful that it was in some ways 'out of this world'? That could have been a scene from Iblard”- Inoue Naohisa. And during this project I created something I can define as out of this world, in other words, from Iblard.
